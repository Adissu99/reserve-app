# Reserve App (W.I.P.)



Reserve is a web application developed using Java, Spring Boot, KeyCloak, Thymeleaf, Spring Data JPA and MySQL.
The project is currently in the Work in Progress (WIP) state and aims to provide an online reservation system for a specific industry or business.
The system allows users to book, check and cancel their reservations through an easy-to-use web interface.
Registration is restricted to users with an invite code generated by another existing user, as the system aims to create a closed user base for enhanced security and privacy.
Key features include the ability to view availability, make and cancel reservations, and receive a confirmation email for registration.
