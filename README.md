# Reserve App (W.I.P.)



This project is made using Java, Spring Boot, KeyCloak, Thymeleaf, Spring Data Jpa, MySQL.

Users can register using an invite code generated by another user, or by an admin. After that, they will receive an email for the confirmation of their account.
When they are activated, they can reserve a "product"/"service" on a selected date and time. There are checks being made for availability for the selected day.
Users can see their info (about themselves, their reservations, users that they invited), and their invite codes.
The admin can add different products, every product having a duration in minutes of a multiply of 15.
